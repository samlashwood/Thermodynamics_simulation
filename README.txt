Task 1- See 'Classballs.py'

Task 2- Run 'OneBallGas.py' for the animation of a single particle gas

Task 3- Run 'ClassGas.py' with the 'Animate' boolean (line17) set to True for the animation of a many particle gas
		If the code saves on running, be sure to set Animate to False before running any other files
		(NB: use of animate boolean suggested in lab script)

Task 4- Discussion of physics concepts can be found in laboratory book.

Task 5- The commented section in lines 120 -124 of 'ClassGas.py' can be uncommentd to show the values of 
		kinetic energy, pressure and total momentum for a series of times.
	Run 'GasSimulation_PTime.py' to produce a graph of pressure with time and see the pressure stabilisation
	Run 'GasSimulation_PT.py' to produce a graph of Pressure against temperature.
	Run 'GasSimulation_MB.py' to produce a normaised histogram of the velocities, the theoretical 
		Maxwell-Boltzmann PDF and to comepare the mean root mean square velocity to it's theoretical value.
	Run 'GasSimulation_NP.py', 'GasSimulation_VT.py' and 'GasSimulation_VP.py' to compare the relations between 
		number of particles and pressure, volume and temperature, and volume and pressure. Graphs of the 
		dependences will be plotted with the expected fits, and the fitting parameters printed.  

Brownian Motion extension- Run 'brownianmotion1.py' for an animation of Brownian motion. 
			   If the Animat Boolean is set to False, a long simulation to track the particle path 
				over a long time will run, and produce an image of the final animation frame,
				with the particle path marked in blue. A PDF histogram will also be produced with the 
				random walks PDF plotted.
